                                        In this exercise, you have to decide which type of variables you have to use (ie. let or const):

                                        Create a global variable called bankAmount which value is the amount of money currently in your account.
                                        Create a variable that saves the % amount of VAT (In Israel, itâ€™s 17%).
                                        Create an array with all your monthly expenses, both positive and negative (money made and money spent).
                                        Example : const details = ["+200", "-100", "+146", "+167", "-2900"]
                                        Create a program that modifies the expenses (ie. the positive AND the negative expenses) so that they will include taxes (multiply each expense by the VAT).
                                        Display your current bankAccount standing at the end of the month.        

                                        */

        let bankAmount = 2000;
        let vat = 17 / 100;
        let monthlyExpenses = ["+1500", "-100", "-500", "-250", "-300"];
        let includeTaxsArr = [];
        let currentBankAccount = 0;
        let expensesModified = () => {
            monthlyExpenses.forEach(element => {
                let includeTaxs = (element) * vat;
                includeTaxsArr.push(includeTaxs)
  // !!! round ede bilersen sifirlarin itmesi ucun

            });
        }
        expensesModified();
        console.log(includeTaxsArr);
        for (expens of includeTaxsArr) {
            currentBankAccount += expens;

        }

        console.log(currentBankAccount);
